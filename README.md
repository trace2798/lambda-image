# Lambda Images

This is a repository for the front-end for my submission for Aws Lambda Hackathon 2025, hosted by Devpost. This is a nextjs application and deployed in amplify. In this application user can upload their desired image and get a optimized version of it. All the endpoint for optimization is [available here](https://github.com/trace2798/lambda-on-fly-image-compression)

Features:

- Create workspace for optimal organization.
- Upload image to get a optimized version of the image.
- Use the generated compress url to do more transformation on the fly using the correct parameters.
- Generate alternate text using AI model.
- In this application for all the images in home page I am using optimized link generated by this application.
